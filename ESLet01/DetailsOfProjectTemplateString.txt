/* Template String*/
1) In ES 6, 
    We have three stylee to declare strings 
    a) double quotes 
        let foo = "Data";
    b) Single quotes 
        let foo = 'Data';
    c) Back Tick\Back Quote 
        let foo = `Data`
2) New Lines 
    a) Double quotes
        let foo = "A "  +
                  "Ball";
        console.log(foo);  //Prints A Ball
        To Print Same Data in Multi - Line 
        let foo = "A \n"  +
                  "Ball";
        console.log(foo);  
        Prints As shown below
        A
        Ball
    b) Single quotes
        let foo = 'A ' +
                  'Ball ';
        console.log(foo); //Print A Ball
        To Print Same Data in Mutli-Line
        let foo =  'A \n' 
                   'Ball ';
        console.log(foo);
        Print As Shown below
        A
        Ball
    c) Back Tick\Back Quotes - Our Hero
       let foo = 
       `A
       Ball`;
       console.log(foo) ;
       Print As shown below
       A
       Ball
3) String interpolation - Using ${ <VariableName>} 
    We can add data dynamically to string variable.
    a) Double Quotes & Single Quotes
        let myName = "CJ"
        let foo = "My Name is ${myName}";
        console.log(foo); 
        //Prints My Name is ${myName}
        let goo = 'My Name is ${ myName }';
        console.log(goo)
        //Prints My Name is ${myName}
    b) Back Tick\Back Quotes
        let coo = `My Name is ${myName}`;
        console.log(coo);
        //Prints My Name is CJ
Conculsion
Back Quote is very useful in creating structured html & string interpolation etc.

Thank You
